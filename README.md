# get_next_line

**42 Project**: `get_next_line` - A function that reads a line from a file descriptor (such as a file or the standard input) one line at a time.

## Project Overview

`get_next_line` is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. This is one of the projects in the 42 curriculum, designed to develop a deep understanding of file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and working with buffers in C.

The goal of the project is to create a function that can handle large files or infinite inputs efficiently by reading one line at a time, regardless of the input's size.

## Features

- Reads one line at a time from a given file descriptor.
- Handles large files or streams by reading input incrementally.
- Efficient memory management and dynamic allocation.
- Handles edge cases like empty lines, no input, and the end of the file.
- Works on files, standard input, and can be used in a variety of applications.

## Getting Started

To begin using `get_next_line`, clone the repository to your local machine:
